This repository is an experimental implementation of the Chord lookup
service and the cooperative file system (CFS). The software is
organized as follows:

chord/ 

   - This directory implements the core of the chord lookup
service. libchord.a implements the API defined in chord.h to maintain
routing tables, add/remove nodes from the network, route simple
queries. libchord also provides a node-to-node RPC service based on
SFS asynchronous RPC.

dhash/

   - DHash depends on chord and builds a replicated block store on the
basic Chord primitive.

lsd/

   - lsd is the Location Service Daemon. It instantiates the Chord and
DHash layers and accepts requests from clients over a UNIX domain
socket.

tools/

   - testing and performance tools

svc/

   - protocol files for the above programs


This software is experimental and under active development. Please
send bug reports/fixes to chord-dev@pdos.lcs.mit.edu.
